\boldsymbol{Y} = \boldsymbol{X\beta} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}

# Matrix-variate outcome

Sometimes each person $i$ might contribute **multiple outcomes** represented in a **matrix**

\begin{equation*}
\boldsymbol{Y}_i 
=
\left(\begin{array}{cccc} 
y_{11} & y_{12} & ... & y_{1m}\\
y_{21} & y_{22} & ... & y_{2m}\\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
y_{r1} & y_{r2} & ... & y_{rm}  
\end{array}\right)
\end{equation*}

For example,

# Matrix-variate regression
- Then, rather than transforming each $\boldsymbol{Y}_i$ into a vector, it may be more straightforward to model $\boldsymbol{Y}_1$, $\boldsymbol{Y}_2$, ..., $\boldsymbol{Y}_n$ as matrices
<br>
--

- The matrix-variate regression of $\boldsymbol{Y} (r \times m)$ on $\boldsymbol{X} (p1 \times p2)$ is
<br>
--

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{Y = \mu + \beta_1 X \beta_2^T + \epsilon}
\end{equation}
where 
  - $\mu (r \times m)$ is...
  - $\beta_1(r\times p_1)$ and $\beta_2 (m \times p2)$ are row and column coefficient matrices
  - $\epsilon(r\times m)$ is a matrix of errors

# Advantages of matrix-variate regression
- Multilevel models generally include random effects to account for component-specific covariances or correlations. The matrix-variate regression does not include random effects as the 'variability within and between variables and occasions holds through the Kronecker product covariance matrix' and no individual-varying parameters are assumed. (1)
-  Matrix-variate analysis can be combined with multilevel models as showed in (3).


If compared with multivariate models, 
- More general without unfolding modes of the three-way data structure.
- Consider both time-dependent and independent covariates and time-dependent responses.
- More realistic situation and more general inferential framework
- Reduced number of estimated parameters
- Consider the correlations between rows and columns

---


# Why is matrix-variate regression not popular?
- Data with matrix-valued response are not commonly encountered until contemporary statistical applications
    + The response are universally reshaped as a vector
    + We have traditional longitudinal models for vector-valued responses.

- High-dimensional data may have sparsity and require regularization. 

- Computation and interpretation might be complicated when incorporating row and column covariances.

- Not many existing estimation packages.

# Methodology extensions

- Longitudinal data %%CITE ALL%%
- Non-normal errors 
- Missing teeth

# Possible applications
- Papermaking with n=48 samples, 4 $\times$ 5 observed matrix (4 quality variables as a function of 5 beating times) for each sample and 4 $\times$ 5 predictors (4 characteristics at 5 beating times) (1)
- Crossover assay of insulin based on rabbit blood sugar concentration. There are a total number of 36 samples. Each subject has a 5 $\times$ 2 response matrix with 5 measurements of blood sugar on each of two days. The covariates are 2 $\times$ 2 with two rows representing standard and test treatments and two columns representing two days. (2)
- Electroencephalogram data. There are 122 subjects. Each subject has measurements of electrical scalp activity as a 256 $\times$ 54 matrix and the predictor is univariate binary.(2,4)
- Physical activity of individuals diagnosed with congestive heart failure over a 4- to 9- period. Each subject i has a 7 $\times$ 144 matrix for each week. (3)
- MRI data for ADHD patients and control. Each patient has a 256 $\times$ 198 $\times$ 256 (downsized to 30 $\times$ 36 $\times$ 30) 3-way tensor response. Predictors include binary group indicator, age and gender. (4)
